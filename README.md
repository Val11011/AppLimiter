# AppLimiter

**AppLimiter is a powerful, self-hosted application usage manager for Linux desktops.**

It runs as a background service to monitor the time you spend on specific applications and
helps you enforce healthy digital habits by setting daily and weekly time limits. When a limit 
is approaching, it provides gentle desktop notifications, and when the time is up, it ensures the 
application is closed after a grace period.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Per-Application Limits**: Set individual time quotas for any application (e.g., games, social media, browsers).
- **Flexible Time Rules**:
    - **Differentiated Limits**: Define separate daily time limits for weekdays (Mon-Fri) and weekends (Sat-Sun).
    - **Weekly Cap**: Enforce a total weekly usage limit.
- **Intelligent Notification System**: Uses `zenity` to display native desktop notifications.
    - **5-Minute Warning**: Get an alert when you are close to reaching a limit.
    - **Grace Period**: Receive a final warning when a limit is hit, with a 5-minute grace period before the app is terminated.
- **Robust Background Service**: Runs as a `systemd` service, reliably started after user login to avoid system boot race conditions.
- **Secure by Design**:
    - **Configuration Delay**: An optional safety feature that queues sensitive changes (like increasing time limits) for a 5-minute delay before they can be applied.
    - **Root Operation**: The daemon runs as `root` to monitor and manage any user process, while notifications are safely displayed on the correct user's desktop.
- **Clean Command-Line Interface**: A simple and powerful CLI to manage all your settings.
